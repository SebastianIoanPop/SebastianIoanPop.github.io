Hello everyone!

This is my first post on my first ever blog!
So to keep up with the standards imposed by all bloggers, I will take the opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is Sebastian Ioan Pop, I am Romanian thus my strange surname "Pop". My middle name can be translated to John however everyone calls me Sebastian.
No, I don't like pop music, it would be very cliché if I did, my preferences go towards rock and metal however occasionally I listen to all the other genres.

I currently call a small room in a shared house from London home however I am originally from Cluj-Napoca Romania.
My dream when I was 3 years old was to become a fire-fighter, at 4 however that changed into wanting to become a software developer, fast-forward 18 years finds me as a Developer for Ve Interactive.

I can't attach a specific to my Developer title, I could say .Net is my primary preference with C# as my favourite language but I am working in both C# and Java.

I started working as a Developer after finishing my first year of University about 2 years ago. Initially I started as a PHP developer with no prior experience.
After 6 months of learning the ropes with a mentor by our side and a project that was meant to ease the job for our Email Specialist team I was moved to C#.

My growth since then has been at a very accelerated pace, I've learned everything I could about TDD and all the famous "best" (common) practices.
Soon I found myself bored of the University subjects, I was so much ahead of everyone else that I would leave my coursework’s to a few hours before the deadline to complete.

Lately I slowed down my rapid growth to set up some solid grounds. I find that I am not comfortable with rushing all this knowledge and leaving major gaps that every other developer knows.

I will keep updating this blog periodically and will probably create a less "professional" blog where I can talk about my other hobbies (I don't want to have a mixed topic blog)

Thank you for taking your time to read my story.

I will see you with my next post (sometime this week or the next)
