# Intro
Hello and welcome to my (previously abandoned) blog!

I'm writing this post so that my players have an easier time knowing what to expect from my D&D games. I fully intend to take my role as a DM further and start doing it regularly.

## I am your (Dungeon) Master

I’m a rather new DM but I have a preference towards storytelling and improvisation. In a world of magic rules are generally chaotic so because of that I do a lot of home brewing which also ensures that you cannot meta game. I don’t alter the CORE rules that you will know and understand, I will not alter your characters without your consent but you may find that the wilderness is a more dangerous place than most guides will tell you. In quality of a player you should not know what the creatures you're facing are fully capable of anyway so that's not even a problem.

# Terms and conditions

### Experience
Experience is earned in milestones, you can level up when I tell you to, levelling up takes 10 days of rest which means that you cannot gain a burst of tactical advantage by holding off a level. Experience is gained by role play and dealing with situations either with combat or avoiding it in a smart way, I will keep track of the milestones&experience.

### Behaviour

Alcohol is cool, smoke breaks halfway in the session, once per session, cellphones and the likes are OK as there are situations where you must take a call but being constantly distracted by them when you don’t have a reason is disrespectful towards the other players as much as towards myself

If you are not paying attention that is considered your character was not paying attention, in combat you will by default take the dodge action if that happens, I don’t want to rush you but I cannot accept consistent delays since we’re pressed on time.

No unnanounced dice rolls, you roll when requested, any other roll will be ignored. If someone rolls to check for traps and then everyone tries I will ignore anyone but the first player that rolled, in that manner I hope you will learn to work as a team and take advantage of your strengths.

Player arguments can be settled with dice rolls but I hope it never comes to that (oh the drama) also PVP is not allowed until later sessions.��Players are allowed to keep secrets from others, you can do so by passing me a note or a message.

We’re all here to have fun and unwind, these rules are meant to be a guide line to anyone that commits to my games, I do make exceptions for new players to allow a period of integration.

### Player discomfort
I need to know if you feel uncomfortable about certain topics and you don’t wish to have the portrayed in the game world... I will avoid the obvious ones but if you are particular about something let me know, forgotten realms is not a kind world.

### Rules & Debates
Rule debates are handled in the following way: If I don’t know a rule and someone says they do and their knowledge is reasonable enough I can decide to follow it until the end of the session, I take the liberty to fix rules that I didn’t have good knowledge about between sessions or approve them as homebrew if they’re better alternatives.

### Murder hobos
If your knives and blades can't stay in their sheat in a normal social encounter you may find that the laws of the world will punish you. Crimes are punished with prison or execution depending on how serious it is.

### Meta knowledge 
Please, don't. If I notice metagaming behaviour I will homebrew&alter to accomodate appropriately, I want my games to be a story of wonderous adventures and magic not a mathematical equation that you have to solve.

### Absences
Come and go as you wish, if you don’t have fun please don’t feel pressured to remain I will put up all these rules so you can check them later. I’d prefer if you can let me know of your absence before the day comes. A minimum of 3 players are required for me to run any prepared content. I prepare content that can be tackled by 3+ players

### Character creation
I'm always hyped by the crazy ideas players come up with so I will not add any constraints on what you can and cannot create. Stat allocation is session 0 so please do not come with prepared characters or be ready to alter them during session 0.

Rolling methods: 4d6d1, 2d6+6, 3d6, 5d4-2 or any other crazy combo that results in 18 depending on what game I'm running depending on how heroic your characters have to be.

I have a set of simple drawbacks for each lowest stat, under 8 stats come with a weight attached to it that we can discuss in session 0, for example lower than 8 intelligence means you cannot read/write.

### Inspiration
I don't like the inspiration system, instead I use a luck point system, each player gets luck for good roleplay or other reasons that I may find fitting. You get 1d4 luck points that you hold in an unlimited pool. Luck points can be added to your dice rolls, as many as you want at once but only up to 20 on the total roll. You can also subtract from the roll. The ratio is 1:1 for your roles and 2:1 if you want to alter someone elses roll.

### Death
Death saving throws are rolled by me behind the screen, I will not tell you the success or failure, but I can record the throws if you wish so. I do this for dramatic purposes.

### Resting
Long rests are 8 hours, short rests are 1 hour, level ups require you to be in town for 10 days training. 

### Combat
Tactics and plans are discussed before combat begins. You have 1 minute after each round to agree on a course of action. You have 6-20 seconds to take your turn. Dodge is the default action if you fail to decide, I will perform a countdown from 3 when the time is up.

Warning! If you spend too much time planning even before combat I will roll to see if you're discovered, the rolls are once a minute or at my own discretion. 

The reasoning behind this is that if you are placed in a real combat scenario you cannot afford to overthink, you act based on instinct and training, your character level will suddenly not just be how powerfull you are but also how confident and experienced in combat you are. You will learn and progress in the same manner as your character which is rather poetic
