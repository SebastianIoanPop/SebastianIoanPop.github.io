## Leveling & Experience

Characters will generally start at 5th level with a few exceptions. Such as introduction of a full new group (level 4) or if there are not games available for a level range the players can create a higher level character to use only in the high level games (rarely will this be the case)

Experience will be gained at the DM's discretion. Due to the nature of pub games we cannot really afford to run pure CR-EXP games or it would feel like progression takes forever. As a consequence we're running more deadly games where you will gain one level per session up to level 10 (unless the DM decides that the session was not worth a full level)

After level 10 however the experience gained will be per encounter to avoid power leveling.


## Downtime

Between sessions your character can do many things, they can rest their lazy butts at one of the taverns of your choice or they can try to do something useful. You can work as a guard, miner, fisher, or anything that makes sense for you to cover your own expenses of living.

Outside of normal expenses short session can be had with any DM if scheduled and booked, you can agree on a course of action and gain some small rewards for doing it. However this sessions should be more focused on character backstory rather than income as the income limits for them are quite low.

Finally you can comission crafters to build things for you, at the right expense you can ask for a ship, a house or a castle to be built or a sword to be forged.

These items can have any flavour you may wish and together with the DMs they will be appropriately balanced for your level.

## Write-ups!

We're creating stories and adventures and while they are fun to experience and enjoy on the moment there is another way to make it better. Write-up! A short story of each session

Players that do so will gain unique bonuses to their characters. Every write-up requires some amount of effort so it's only fair that a reward is given

They also help us organise the lore and events of the world into a logical order, each character has therefor a journal and journal entries can be kept personal or made public at your discretion. In character write-ups that are not made public cannot be referenced by your character whilst the ones that are made public are knowledge to all the readers. (this is a bit of RP element to avoid/allow some level of meta gaming and make it seem not so meta)
